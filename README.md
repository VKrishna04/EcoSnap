### **EcoSnap: AI-Powered Environmental Issue Detector** üåçüì∏
**Theme:** Environmental Sustainability

#### **Problem Statement**
Many environmental issues, such as illegal waste dumping, deforestation, and polluted water bodies, go unnoticed or unreported. There‚Äôs a need for a system that allows citizens to easily report and track such issues in real-time.

#### **Solution**
**EcoSnap** is a **mobile/web application** that uses **AI-powered image recognition** and **geolocation tracking** to detect and report environmental issues instantly. Users can snap a photo of pollution, illegal waste, or deforestation, and the system will:
‚úÖ **Classify the issue** (e.g., air pollution, water pollution, waste, deforestation).
‚úÖ **Identify severity** using AI models trained on environmental datasets.
‚úÖ **Tag the location** automatically using GPS.
‚úÖ **Notify local authorities/NGOs** for action.
‚úÖ **Gamify user participation** by rewarding users with points for reporting issues.
